# Counting-Coins-through-Watershed-Image-Segmentation
A Python program that counts the coins of a specific image through the use of watershed segmentation and Open-CV libraries.

It's a modified code from the sample available in Open-CV Python's website. I have tried to expand upon it more and added in the counting function.
